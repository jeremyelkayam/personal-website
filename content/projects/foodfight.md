*Food Fight* was a 2D tower-defense video game created for the class **Intro to Video Game Design and Development** at William & Mary. The game features a 4 different tower types with branching upgrades for a total of 16 towers, 3 different types of enemies with procedural variation in stats, a money system, and procedurally generated maps. All of the game's artwork was created by me. I also did a lot of programming work on the project, creating all of the enemy unit systems, and helping to debug the map creation engine. I also implemented variable gameplay speeds. I enjoyed working on the game so much that I became addicted to playing it! As a result, I playtested the heck out of the game when it was close to done, and added balance changes and new mechanics to make the game more fun as I saw fit! I had a great experience working on Food Fight, and it influenced lots of my future projects.
