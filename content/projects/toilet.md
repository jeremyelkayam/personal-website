*Go To The Toilet* is an animated music video for the song [Go To The Toilet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcqHr8gpba0) by Dave Bulmer. I didn't make the song, but everything you see in the video was drawn and animated by me. I worked on this video during my free time at university from April 2019 to March 2020. I wasn't at school over the summer of 2019 (mid-May to mid-August), so I wasn't working on it then. The video was inspired by the works of [Dave and Abby Bulmer](http://dumpylittlerobot.com/) as well as the [Powered by the Cheat cartoons from Homestar Runner](http://www.hrwiki.org/wiki/Powered_by_The_Cheat). To create the music video, I used Adobe Animate CC 2019 and a Wacom Cintiq 13HD tablet, both on loan from William & Mary's media center. This was an amazing project to work on, because it combined a lot of different things I love in an interesting way that allowed me to learn lots of new things (including animation and drawing) but also incorporate things I already knew (like coding, comedy, and of course, copious research on my various inspirations). It's pretty different from my normal work in software development, but I did do some coding with Animate's ActionScript language, and obviously art, visual design, and animation play a role in the creation of software.
