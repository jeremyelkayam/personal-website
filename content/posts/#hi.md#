Hi, it's me, Jeremy Elkayam. I made a website because I figured it was time I had one. It has a blog, because I wanted it to have a blog. I like to write about things that I do, so I'm going to do that on this blog.


## Where I Started

Because I like to do things out of order, the first thing I did was register a domain name. You don't need to do that first. In fact, you should probably do it right when you're almost ready to publish your website.

Because I'm a computer type person, I like to kinda get my hands dirty with some code and doing things a little bit more on my own than I otherwise might with a web authoring tool. So, I decided to host my site using GitHub Pages, and having never done any webdev before, I decided to poke around and see what I wanted to do. After looking through some portfolio templates, I stumbled upon something called a Hugo theme. I didn't know what Hugo was, so I looked around and tried downloading it for myself, and liked what I saw.

## Hugo
Hugo is a web authoring tool for people who like Markdown and want to get their hands a little dirty with coding, but don't want to go full webdev. Since my university's CS program offered exactly zero webdev classes, Hugo has been a good fit for me. Hugo also offers extremely quick build times, allowing you to save a file and see the results basically instantly. However, there are some things I don't like about it. It doesn't require very much to be standardized across themes, so it's hard to migrate your site from theme to theme. But overall, it's worked out well for me so far, and I'd recommend it to people like me, who know Markdown but aren't webdev people in the slightest. I know the slightest bit of CSS, which suits me because I can add my own CSS as well.

## Where I Ended

Well, I ended up with this website. And I'm pretty happy with it too! I'll be posting in this blog on a whenever-I-feel-like-it basis.
