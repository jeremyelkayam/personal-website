Just like most people who can afford video games, I’ve spent the last few months playing [Animal Crossing: New Horizons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Crossing:_New_Horizons), the latest entry in Nintendo’s long-running Animal Crossing franchise. I’ve been playing Animal Crossing since I was eight years old, but I’ve been playing this one a bit differently from how I’ve played in the past. Now, for the first time ever, my choices in dressing up my Animal Crossing character have begun to define how I dress in real life.

In previous Animal Crossing games, I didn’t pay very close attention to how my character or my house looked. If I found something cool, I would wear it. Or maybe I’d put it into my house. This, of course, meant I ended up with a disorganized house full of esoteric, impractical crap. It was exactly how you might expect an 8-year-old boy with unlimited space to deck out his bedroom.

But I quickly grew unsatisfied with this method of organizing my virtual life. As I grew older and moved onto the next two Animal Crossing games, City Folk and New Leaf, I began pursuing more organized, themed rooms and outfits. When I started New Leaf, I was finishing my first year of high school and was still wearing whatever clothes my parents were buying for me, so I went wild with crazy but coordinated looks.

It’s been 6 years since I stopped playing New Leaf, and nearly 8 since it first came out. My age has nearly tripled since my parents first bought me Wild World as a present for finishing second grade. I’ve grown a lot in the intervening years, and as such, my playstyle has changed. New Horizons’ lack of theme-coordinated “furniture series” inspired me to take a different approach with my home. This time, I wanted to make my virtual house into one that I’d actually like to live in. This quickly extended to my clothing. I started dressing my character up in clothes that I actually enjoy wearing, but I quickly realized I wasn’t satisfied in my character’s reasonable facsimile of my real-life garb. My signature black rectangular glasses (which I continued wearing only because I thought they looked nice when I was 10) just didn’t look good. They didn’t properly show off my character’s big beautiful eyes.

So I started experimenting, and discovered one of New Horizons’ greatest strengths. Previous games forced you to rifle through closets in search of your clothing, giving only a name as identification of what the clothing actually was. In order to wear an outfit, you’d have to drag items on and off of your character from your inventory screen. But New Horizons completely overhauls the storage system and gives closets their own dress-up menu.

With New Horizons, designing your character’s outfit has become a game unto itself. After some experimentation, I discovered I liked the look of the browline and double-bridged glasses. After spending several months looking at my Animal Crossing character wearing these glasses, I finally realized that if I liked how my character looked in them, I’d probably like how I looked in them too. So I bit the bullet and ordered a pair each of aviators and browlines! I started playing this new Animal Crossing with the idea that I’d imitate how I really want to live my life, but that ended up teaching me more about my own sense of fashion!

This is a small digression, but I promise it ties back to my original point. One of the things I’ve tried to learn more about in 2020 is my own personal taste. Since I started cooking for myself more in 2018, I’ve watched tons of cooking videos online. Around last fall or so, I discovered [Adam Ragusea’s YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/aragusea), and it’s quickly become one of the more influential voices in my life, in and out of the kitchen. Adam Ragusea puts a lot of emphasis on the fact that he cooks his food the way he likes it. He encourages his viewers to discover how they like their food, and adapt techniques and recipes to suit their own tastes.

I’ve really taken this advice to heart, and it made me realize that there’s a lot I don’t know about what I like, beyond just food. For at least 6 years I’ve been wearing the same blue jeans and henley shirts my parents bought for me when I was in high school. I don’t know if that’s what I like. I didn’t know this when I started playing, but my current method of playing Animal Crossing has made it a great set of training wheels to help me discover what I like. This game’s release has coincided with my graduation from college and subsequent starting of a new life on my own, so it’s been a very happy coincidence that it’s been able to help me at just the right time in my life.
