I'm a 22-year-old computer geek with a lot of different interests. I've taken to labeling myself as a "thing maker" because, while extremely broad, it's a nice catch-all for the things in my life that I'm passionate about. I have a BS in computer science and I get paid to develop software, but I also make apps and games on my own time for no reason other than personal fulfillment. I've dabbled in almost every medium of digital art for one project or another. I've filmed, edited, and even animated videos for fun. This website is intended to be a record of all the things I do!
